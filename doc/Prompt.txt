You have left out several important sections, including the Example Workflow, Technical Specifications, and the Sample Code Skeleton for the AI Agent. Therefore, I need you to thoroughly complete these sections, ensuring that the content is detailed, well-structured, and curated appropriately. Please do not shorten the content; instead, provide a comprehensive and descriptive approach while maintaining clear and organized structure.

I recently joined a company called GoComet, and it has been a week since I started. We have an upcoming one-week hackathon, and I need to participate. The problem statement is related to existing products, and my team consists of three members: one handling the frontend, one working on the backend, and myself as the backend intern. This hackathon is specifically for the interns hired by the company, and we have two mentors assigned: one for backend and one for frontend. These mentors are experienced SDEs with extensive years of work in this field and at the company. I will be receiving the problem statement and will need to complete it. I’m seeking guidance on how to approach and build the project.

Project Statement:
    The task is to build an AI-based support agent for document reading, particularly when information is missed during extraction. The customer should be able to interact with the agent, specify which data was missed, and provide a method for retrieving that data.
    Please refer to GoComet’s "Go Invoice" product, as it seems to align with the problem statement. I’ve also discussed this with my assigned mentor, who suggested breaking the problem into two main parts:
    1. Document Upload and Parsing:
        In this part, a document is uploaded, parsed using regex and other methods, and the text is extracted into a readable format, such as JSON. However, sometimes users may input incorrect details, causing the parser to fail and resulting in missing data. The customer should be able to tell the agent about the missing information.
    2. AI-based Data Prediction:
        Once data is identified as missing, AI will be used to predict the correct information based on the document. The AI will automatically identify and provide the missing details to ensure accuracy and completeness.
    For the project, you don’t have to use all the technologies mentioned by the team. I plan to use Node.js for the backend.
    I need a detailed plan outlining the steps I should take, along with the tasks I need to complete. How should I approach and build this project?

GoComet Onboarding
    👥 Team Size: 4 interns per team (5 teams in total) [BE/FE/QA] & 2 mentors

🚀 The Challenge
    Each team must ideate, develop, and deploy a SaaS product that:
    ✅ Solves a real business problem (after discussing with the product team).
    ✅ Uses AI tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and LangChain for coding, automation, and intelligence.
    ✅ Uses no-code tools for UI, database, automation, and analytics.
    ✅ Implements custom backend logic (Ruby or Node.js).
    ✅ Has authentication, data storage, admin dashboard, analytics, and automation.
    ✅ Is deployed and demonstrated live at the end of the assignment.
