1. Integrate IP address into the schema.
2. Capture and store the IP address during document upload: When uploading a document, capture the user's IP address and save it in the database alongside the document to associate the document with the respective IP address.
3. Retrieve documents by IP: When fetching documents, ensure that all documents linked to the current IP address are retrieved.

4. Document extraction prompt: For document extraction, provide a prompt for the AI model to extract the relevant data from the document and store it in the database.
5. Implement in sections:
   DocData: {
        // General user and document information
        details: {
            "invoiceNumber": "INV-123",
            "invoiceDate": "2021-09-01",
            weight: 100,
            name: "John Doe",
        },
        // Table of items
        items: {
            "item1": {
                "name": "Item 1",
                "quantity": 1,
                "price": 100
            },
            "item2": {
                "name": "Item 2",
                "quantity": 2,
                "price": 200
            }
        }
        //
    }
